# OAuth 2

OAuth 2 is a protocol that allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one site, to another site, without having to expose their credentials. This mechanism is used by companies to allow customers to access their data in other services, like Facebook Login. It's also used to allow users to share data with third party services.
